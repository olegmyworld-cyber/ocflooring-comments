### Bona sealer widget — "CUSTOMER FAVORITE" badge overlap (2026-06-14)

**Problem:** On mobile, the red `★ CUSTOMER FAVORITE` badge overlaid on the room
image overlapped the `LIVING / KITCHEN` room toggle pills in the Bona tone/sealer
widget (`#oc-tone-steps` / `#bona-tone-widget`).

**Fix:** Merged a badge-overlap guard into the existing `BonaMobileFix`
(`bonamobilefix`) script rather than adding a new one (the site footer was at its
15-script-per-block limit). The guard finds the badge and toggle by their visible
text (robust to the minified widget bundle's class names), measures their live
bounding boxes, and only repositions the badge (nudges it just below the toggle row)
when they actually overlap. Also keeps the badge on one line / slightly smaller on
phones. See [`webflow-scripts/bonamobilefix-1.0.0.js`](webflow-scripts/bonamobilefix-1.0.0.js).

Published live to `nwocflooring.com`, `www.nwocflooring.com`, and the Webflow
subdomain.
